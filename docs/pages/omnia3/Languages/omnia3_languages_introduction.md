## 1. Introduction

The OMNIA platform was designed based on the theoretical principles of language design and model-driven engineering, following similar principles to the Object Management Group's standard of [Meta-Object Facility (MOF)](http://www.omg.org/mof/) and its related languages such as the [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) and the [Unified Modeling Language (UML)](http://www.uml.org/).

Here we explain what the different languages that exist in the platform are, as well as introducing our analogue to MOF, the **Meta-Entity Framework (MEF)**.
