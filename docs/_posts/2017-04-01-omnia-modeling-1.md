# 2. OMNIA Modeling Environment

## 1. First Steps on the OMNIA Modeler

At this initial point, your **Tenant** was already defined, so you're ready to access OMNIA platform's Main Menu.

Please observe the Left Side Down menu's option ***Go to***.

Once you click on the **Modeler** option, you'll be able to shape all the figures which will compose your business application.

## 2. Modeling Agents

Firstly, you'll define the Entities of your interaction: the **Agents** - in this case,  a ***Company*** and ***Supplier***

## 3. Modeling a Resource
 
OMNIA's Platform Modeler obeys to REA's business process modeling system. As a Modeling User, you can draw up your **Commitment** constituted by **Agents** and **Resources**, each one of them with their own **Attributes** and **Behaviours**. Said this, it's time to add a new **Resource** and rename it as**Item**.

## 4. Create a new build

**For each time** you fill up your data on the Modeler Menu, don't forget to click on ***Create a new build***, in order to gather all kind of data that you're incorporating in the application.

Always bear in mind that you are able to create as many elements you want, as OMNIA offers you **infinite development and integration interfaces**.




## 5. Identify your Entities

As you reach the **Application Environment**, all *Entities* previously established are about to be renamed. Reappoint your **Company**, **Supplier** and **Item** with a *Code* and *Name* respectively (**note: both code and Name must have similar identity**)

## 6. Commitment

With **Agents** and **Resources** already identified, just proceed to a new **Commitment**, naming it ***GoodsPurchaseRequest***.

## 6.1. Adding an attribute to your Commitment

Now that your Application is on the run, you may characterize it with several **Attributes**, by determining their own *Codes* and *Types*.

## 6.1.1. Editing an Attribute in your Commitment

Still in the field *Commitment*,  edit the **Attribute** ***Amount*** and update its element *Is read only?* with a check mark.

## 6.2. Adding a behaviour to your Commitment

**Behaviours** execute and simplify the **calculation method** of all variables inserted into the **Application**, such as *Attributes*. You can do it by adding several new ***Formulas***, ***Actions***, ***Initializers*** and ***Finalizers*** (**note: see the Advanced Tutorial for further instructions**).

## 7. Document

The **Document**  exemplifies the transition from the Modeler environment into the Application. For instance, on a **B2B Buying Process** - while using OMNIA Platform's - the **Document** will describe all ***Items*** exchanged between **Agents** - ***Supplier*** and ***Company***. Therefore, it will be renamed as ***PurchaseOrder***.

## 7.1. Adding Attributes to your Document

As previously described, you can also designate new **Attributes** to your **Document**, with *Code* and *Type* correspondingly, and associate both to your **Agents**.

## 8. Perform a new build

![enter image description here](http://funkyimg.com/i/2DRx6.png)

And then, **confirm** your new build request:

## 9. Originate your Purchase Order Serie

When you choose the option *+Add new*, OMNIA creates automatically a *Serie* to your **PurchaseOrder** Document, in order to identify it afterwards.

## 10. Create your Purchase Order

Now that you are on the **Application** Environment, go to **Documents** and your ***PurchaseOrder*** **Document** is now available with the **Attributes** previously defined on the **Modeler**

## 11. How to reorganize your Purchase Order's Form

## 11.1. Manage your User Interface Elements

Return to your ***PurchaseOrder*** **Document** on the Modeling Environment and manage the **Attributes** *Serie* and *Number*, by re-positioning them on the *User Interface*'s dashboard. You are allowed not only to replace Rows and Columns, but also to re-establish the **size** and **position** of their fields (*Serie* has been re-positioned on the Row and Column 1 respectively, and *Number* is now present on the Row 1, Column 5) 

Below you'll also notice how ***Company*** and ***Supplier*** have been moved-up).

## 11.3. Simplify your Purchase Order's Screen

 Still, there a couple of elements that could be simplified in your **PurchaseOrder**'s Screen. Return to the ***User Interface*** area and delete the **Attributes** *Code*, *Provider* and *Receiver*, as they have been replaced already by ***Supplier*** and ***Company***, respectively.

## 11.4 Adding new elements to your User Interface

Finally, it's time to add one last **Attribute** to you **PurchaseOrder**'s User Interface, as the one comprised as ***UnitPrice***, establishing at the same time its Row, Column and Size.
