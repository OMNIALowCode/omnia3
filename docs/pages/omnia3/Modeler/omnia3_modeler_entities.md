## 1. Introduction

In _OMNIA Platform_ you can add your own entities, each one represeting one of the following concepts: __Agents, Resources, Commitments, Events, Documents or Generic entities__.

In each entity, it's possible to define the attributes, the behaviours and the user interface,

## 2. Attributes
__*Entity / Attributes*__

## 3. Behaviours
__*Entity / Behaviours*__

Click [here](omnia3_modeler_behaviours.html), to know more about behaviours.

## 4. User Interface
__*Entity / User Interface*__

In _OMNIA Platform_ you can customize how the fields are shown in the form to create or edit of your entity.

Automatically, the platform adds and removes user interface elements when a new attribute is added or an existing one is deleted from an entity.
