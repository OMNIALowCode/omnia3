## 1. Introduction

The _Modeler_ is the area where the model development occurs.

To create new _OMNIA_ applications you must understand the [modeling lifecycle](omnia3_modeler_lifecycle.html), in order to follow the best development practices.

## 2. Understanding the homepage
Accessing the _Modeler_ you will see three differents things:
* Statistics: a set of counters to inform you of how many entities the model has;
* Build information: the current build version and how many pending changes exists since the last builld;
* History: the last model changes;

## 3. Understanding the menu
The menu has entries to each one of the [entities](omnia3_modeler_entities.html), as well to the [Data Analytics](omnia3_modeler_datavisualization.html) and the Versioning mechanisms.
