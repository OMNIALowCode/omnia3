## 1. Authorization management in the **OMNIA Platform**

The authorization management is divided in two main areas, the platform authorization and the [tenant](omnia3_management_introduction.html) authorization.

### 1.1 Platform

In the platform authorization area you can manage the automatically created policies and roles besides the policies and roles created by you for the platform global security.

For each tenant in the platform a policy with code Administration[TenantCode] was created. Each policy contains at least the automatically create role with the code Administration.

Aside from the policies for each tenant a polic with code PlatformPolicy is created. This policy let you manage the permissions for the platform management.
